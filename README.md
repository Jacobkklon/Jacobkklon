### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Jacob and I'm a passionate young professional interested in programming and data science!

I love operations research, novel problems with creative solutions, statistics, probability, and automation and control of large physical systems.

Education: RU '22 Industrial and Systems Engineering
Location: NY Metro Area (NJ)
Certifications: Microsoft Azure AZ-900 Fundamentals, SQL for Data Science (UC Davis), Agile Software Development
Competencies: Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Open-CV, Numpy, Matplotlib), R, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI

ðŸ”­ I currently work as a Consultant at Capgemini in NYC where I've worked on Logistics IT Application Operations and Integraded Business Planning in SAP.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently studying up on data structures and algorithms.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about modeling and simulation! This is an area I'm incredibly passionate at as these concepts are incredibly powerful but we must understand what they DO and DON'T enable us to do.

âš¡ Fun fact: Over the past two years I've learned and practiced Bass Guitar! I love slap bass and funky msuic and I've been steadily learning some of my favorite songs!
