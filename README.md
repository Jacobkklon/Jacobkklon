### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Jacob and I'm a passionate young professional interested in programming and data science!

âœ¨ I love operations research, novel problems with creative solutions, statistics, probability, and automation and control of large physical systems. Please take a look at my pinned projects below to get an idea of my experience!

**Education:** RU '22 Industrial and Systems Engineering  
**Location:** NY Metro Area (NJ)  
**Certifications:** Microsoft Azure AZ-900 Fundamentals, SQL for Data Science, Agile Software Development, Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt
**Competencies:** Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Open-CV, Numpy, Matplotlib), R, SQL, C, Tableau, and Power BI  

ðŸ”­ I currently work as a Consultant at Capgemini in NYC where I've worked on Logistics IT Application Operations and am now learning about Integrated Business Planning in SAP.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently improving my knowledge on data structures and algorithms.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about modeling and simulation! I love this area because these concepts are incredibly powerful but we must understand what they DO and DON'T enable us to do.

âš¡ Fun fact: Over the past two years I've learned and practiced Bass Guitar. I love slap bass and funky music and I've been steadily learning some of my favorite songs!
